\subsection{Graphical User Interface Development}
Graphical User Interface (GUI) development encompasses the design, implementation, and evaluation of visual and interactive elements through which users interact with a system. In contrast to command-line interfaces, GUIs rely on graphical components such as windows, menus, buttons, icons, and form elements that mediate user input and system feedback. At its core, GUI development seeks to align these components with users' perceptual, cognitive, and motor capabilities, as well as with their goals and tasks in a given context of use.
In the context of software systems, it is useful to distinguish
between \emph{GUI design} and \emph{GUI development}.
GUI design focuses on the conceptual and visual aspects of
an interface: information architecture, interaction flows,
layout, typography, colours, and overall look-and-feel.
Its goal is to define \emph{what} the interface should
communicate and \emph{how} interaction should feel from
a user’s perspective.

GUI development, in contrast, comprises the engineering
activities required to turn these design artefacts into a robust,
interactive, and maintainable software component. It focuses
on \emph{how} the specified interface is realised in code, how
it behaves under different conditions, and how it integrates
with the underlying application logic and data sources.

From an engineering perspective, GUI development typically
involves (i) translating user and system requirements into
concrete UI behaviour and constraints, (ii) selecting suitable
frameworks and architectural patterns (e.g., MVC or MVVM),
(iii) implementing components, event handling, state
management, and validation, and (iv) assuring quality through
testing, performance optimisation, and accessibility checks.
These steps are usually executed iteratively based on feedback
from usage data and evaluation.

Modern GUI development is further constrained by platform
guidelines and conventions (e.g., operating system human
interface guidelines or web standards), which define common
interaction patterns and affordances. Adhering to these
conventions reduces users’ learning effort and supports
consistency across applications, while still leaving room
for product-specific branding and interaction styles.

Importantly, GUI development is not a purely technical
exercise. Implementation decisions about layout structure,
interaction complexity, feedback timing, and support for
assistive technologies implicitly encode assumptions about
the intended user population. If these assumptions do not
match the actual user base, the resulting interface may be
correct from an implementation standpoint but still fail in
terms of usability and accessibility.

In the following, we therefore focus on how characteristics
of the target user group inform GUI design and development.
We first distinguish demographics from user personas and
discuss how both perspectives can be combined to derive
concrete implications for graphical user interfaces.


\subsection{User Demographics vs.\ Personas}
Firstly it is important to distinguish these two terms, since Demographics and user personas capture two complementary perspectives on users in GUI development.

\textbf{Demographics} provide a population-level view that is grounded in observable facts. Attributes such as age, abilities, cultural background, and prior experience reveal systematic differences in perception, motor skills, cognitive load, and typical usage situations\cite{world2008web, rodriguez2022prototype, clemmensen2009cultural, atata2025designing, salminen2021survey}. This evidence is essential for defining baseline requirements for usability and accessibility, for example regarding font sizes, color contrast, input modalities, or supported services. Several guidelines and standards, such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and platform-specific human interface guidelines, explicitly build on such demographic and accessibility considerations to derive concrete design recommendations. However, demographic categories like ``65+'' or ``visually impaired'' remain coarse, as they do not specify concrete goals, everyday tasks, or the actual usage context of a system.

\textbf{Personas} are used to translate such abstract differences into concrete user archetypes that describe typical goals, tasks, and contexts of a target group\cite{gomez2023design}. They help teams design for specific needs instead of an undefined ``average user'' and provide a shared reference for design decisions. However, personas are frequently criticized when they are created without empirical grounding and instead rely on stereotypes or personal assumptions\cite{wagner2014impact}.

Combining both perspectives mitigates these limitations. Demographic evidence can ground personas by ensuring that relevant constraints and user groups are covered, while personas operationalize demographic insights into concrete scenarios and design implications\cite{rodriguez2022prototype,clemmensen2009cultural, howard2015personas}. In this way, demographics define the breadth and diversity of the user population, and personas turn this breadth into actionable guidance for GUI design.
