\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a structured literature review on how user personas and demographic factors influence graphical user interface (GUI) development. We systematically analyze existing research on persona-based design, demographic differences in user populations (e.g., age, expertise, and cultural background), and their reported impact on usability and user experience. The reviewed work shows that personas are widely used as tools for communication and design rationale, yet only a subset of studies empirically evaluates their contribution to improved GUI quality. Demographic factors are frequently acknowledged but are often treated superficially or inconsistently operationalized across studies. Based on our synthesis, we propose a conceptual framework that links personas, demographics, and GUI design decisions, identify gaps in current research (such as limited validation of personas and narrow demographic sampling), and outline implications and directions for future work in persona-driven, demographically aware GUI development.
